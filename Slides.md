## System Objectives & Deliverables

• Centralized web platform for community service discovery via interactive maps
• Real-time service updates by authorized managers ensuring reliable information
• User-provider collaboration through feedback enhancing transparency and trust
• Contributing to SDG 10 and 11 by reducing service access disparities

 CommuMap addresses fragmented community service information by creating a unified platform where residents can locate essential services like clinics, shelters, and food banks. The system enables real-time updates from service managers and incorporates user feedback to maintain data accuracy and build community trust.

## System Scope

• Interactive map with real-time rendering of essential community services
• Advanced search filters by category distance and availability status
• Live status feeds with capacity indicators and closure alerts
• Emergency "Help Me Now" button for verified nearby resources
• Role-based dashboards for managers moderators and administrators
• Responsive UI optimized for desktop tablet and mobile devices

 The system focuses on core functionalities including an interactive map interface, advanced filtering capabilities, and real-time status updates. It supports multiple user roles with specialized dashboards while maintaining a responsive design to serve users across all device types.

## System Overview

• Django-based web application with REST API architecture
• Role-based access control supporting four user types
• Real-time capacity monitoring with visual indicators
• Integrated feedback and moderation workflow system
• Mobile-first responsive design for accessibility
• PostgreSQL database with geospatial PostGIS extensions

 CommuMap is built as a modern Django web application featuring role-based access control for different user types. The system provides real-time monitoring capabilities and includes comprehensive feedback mechanisms, all delivered through a mobile-responsive interface with geospatial database support.

## Component-Level Diagram

• Core module handles authentication landing pages and RBAC middleware
• Services module manages service discovery mapping and capacity tracking
• Feedback module processes user comments ratings and moderation workflows
• Users module provides profile management and role assignments
• Managers module enables service provider dashboard and real-time updates
• Moderators module facilitates content verification and community moderation
• Console module delivers admin interface for system-wide management

 The system architecture consists of seven main Django applications, each handling specific domain responsibilities. Components communicate through REST APIs and shared database models, with the core module providing authentication and access control services that other modules depend on.

## Software Architecture

• Presentation layer using Django templates with responsive Bootstrap styling
• API layer built with Django REST Framework for mobile integration
• Domain layer containing business logic across specialized Django applications
• Infrastructure layer supporting PostgreSQL Redis and Celery background processing
• Middleware layer implementing custom RBAC and security controls
• Deployment layer using Docker containers with Nginx load balancing

The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns. The presentation layer provides web interfaces while the API layer enables future mobile app integration. Business logic is encapsulated in domain-specific Django apps, supported by robust infrastructure including database clustering and background task processing.

## Input & Output

• User inputs include service searches location filters and feedback submissions
• Manager inputs provide service details capacity updates and closure alerts
• System outputs deliver interactive maps filtered results and notifications
• API outputs enable mobile integration and third-party service consumption
• Admin outputs include user management reports and system monitoring
• Notification outputs support email alerts and dashboard updates

 The system processes various input types from different user roles and provides corresponding outputs through multiple channels. Users interact primarily through the web interface while managers update service information and administrators oversee system operations through specialized dashboards.

## Solution Achieved?

• Successfully implemented unified service discovery platform reducing information fragmentation
• Delivered real-time capacity monitoring with visual indicators for better decision-making
• Established comprehensive RBAC system supporting multiple stakeholder types
• Created mobile-responsive interface ensuring accessibility across device types
• Integrated feedback mechanisms building community trust and data accuracy
• Deployed scalable architecture supporting future growth and mobile expansion

 The project successfully delivers on its core objectives by creating a unified platform that reduces information barriers. The implemented solution provides real-time capabilities, comprehensive user management, and accessible interfaces while establishing a foundation for future scalability and mobile integration.
